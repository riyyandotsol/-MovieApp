MovieApp is a modern web application built with **React** and **Vite** that lets users search for movies using **The Movie Database (TMDb)** API and discover trending films based on what others are searching. It features real-time search, Appwrite integration, and a slick, responsive UI.

## 📈 How Trending Movies Work

Every time a user searches and selects a movie, it is logged in **Appwrite**. The "Trending Movies" section then displays films ranked by how frequently they've been searched across all users.
